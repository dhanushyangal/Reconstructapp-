# New Sign-Up Flow Guide

## Overview
The sign-up flow has been updated to provide a better user experience. Instead of redirecting to the login page after registration, users now see a dedicated verification completion page where they can confirm their email verification and proceed to the home page.

## New Flow

### 1. User Registration
- User fills out registration form (username, email, password)
- Clicks "Sign up" button
- Registration process starts with loading indicator

### 2. Registration Success
- User is automatically navigated to **Verification Completion Page**
- No more redirect to login page
- Clear instructions about email verification

### 3. Verification Completion Page
- **Success message**: "Account Created Successfully!"
- **Welcome message**: "Welcome, [username]!"
- **Email instructions**: Clear guidance about checking email
- **Verification button**: "I've Verified My Email" button
- **Help options**: "Didn't receive the email?" link

### 4. Email Verification
- User receives verification email
- Clicks verification link
- Email is verified in Supabase

### 5. Proceed to Home Page
- User clicks "I've Verified My Email" button
- System checks if email is verified
- If verified: Navigate to home page
- If not verified: Show message to check email first

## What Changed

### Key Features:

  final String email;
  final String username;
  
  // Shows success message, email instructions, and verification button
}
```

Navigator.pushReplacement(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => VerificationCompletionPage(
      email: _emailController.text.trim(),
      username: _usernameController.text.trim(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

#### Verification Check:
```dart
// Check if user is verified
final currentUser = _authService.currentUser;
if (currentUser != null && currentUser.emailConfirmedAt != null) {
  // User is verified, proceed to home page
  Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil('/home', (route) => false);
} else {
  // User not verified yet, show message
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    const SnackBar(
      content: Text('Please check your email and click the verification link first.'),
      backgroundColor: Colors.orange,
    ),
  );
