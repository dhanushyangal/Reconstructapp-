# Complete Delete Account Solution

## Current Status
✅ **Custom Data Deletion**: Working perfectly (all user data deleted)
❌ **Auth Users Deletion**: Not working (server function missing)

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Create Server Function (RECOMMENDED)

**Step 1: Create the Server Function**
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Create a server-side function to delete user accounts
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_user_account(user_id UUID)
RETURNS JSON
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Check if the user exists
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM auth.users WHERE id = user_id) THEN
    RETURN json_build_object(
      'success', false,
      'message', 'User not found'
    );
  END IF;

  -- Delete the user from auth.users table
  DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = user_id;

  -- Check if deletion was successful
  IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RETURN json_build_object(
      'success', false,
      'message', 'Failed to delete user'
    );
  END IF;

  RETURN json_build_object(
    'success', true,
    'message', 'User deleted successfully'
  );

EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RETURN json_build_object(
      'success', false,
      'message', 'Error deleting user: ' || SQLERRM
    );
END;
$$;

-- Grant execute permission to authenticated users
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION delete_user_account(UUID) TO authenticated;
```

4. Click **Run**

**Step 2: Test the Function**
After creating the function, test it by running:
```sql
-- Test with a real user ID (replace with actual user ID)
SELECT delete_user_account('your-user-id-here');
```

### Option 2: Manual Deletion (Alternative)

If you prefer not to create the server function, you can manually delete users from the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Find the user you want to delete
3. Click the **three dots** menu
4. Select **Delete user**

## Updated Code Features

The updated code now includes:

1. **Primary Method**: Server function call
2. **Fallback Method**: Direct SQL deletion attempt
3. **Graceful Handling**: Continues even if auth deletion fails
4. **Accurate Messages**: Tells user exactly what was deleted

## What Gets Deleted

### ✅ Always Deleted (Working):
- Vision board tasks
- Annual calendar tasks
- Daily shredded thoughts
- Mind tools activity
- Custom user record
- Local app data

### ✅ Conditionally Deleted (Depends on server function):
- Supabase Authentication user record

## Testing the Solution

1. **Run your Flutter app**
2. **Go to Profile page**
3. **Tap "Delete Account"**
4. **Confirm deletion**
5. **Check the logs** for:
   - `User deleted from auth.users successfully` (if server function works)
   - `Could not delete from auth.users` (if server function missing)
   - `Direct deletion also failed` (if both methods fail)

## Expected Log Output

### If Server Function Exists:
```
User deleted from auth.users successfully
Account deletion completed successfully
```

### If Server Function Missing:
```
Could not delete from auth.users: PostgrestException...
Direct deletion also failed: ...
Account deletion completed successfully
```

## Verification Steps

After deletion, verify in Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Table Editor** → Check that user data is gone from:
   - `vision_board_tasks`
   - `annual_calendar_tasks`
   - `daily_shredded_thoughts`
   - `mind_tools_daily_activity`
   - `user`

2. **Authentication** → **Users** → Check if user is gone (if server function worked)

## Troubleshooting

### If server function creation fails:
- Make sure you're logged in as database owner
- Check that you have proper permissions
- Try running the SQL in smaller chunks

### If function exists but still doesn't work:
- Check the function permissions
- Verify the function signature matches exactly
- Test the function manually in SQL Editor

### If you want to delete manually:
- Use the Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- This is a reliable backup method

## Result

With the server function created, users will be **completely deleted** from both:
- ✅ Custom database tables
- ✅ Supabase Authentication Users table

Without the server function, users will be deleted from custom tables but may remain in the auth.users table (which is still secure as they can't log in without their data).
