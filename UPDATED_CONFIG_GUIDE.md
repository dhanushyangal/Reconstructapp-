# Updated Configuration: Strict Email Verification - No Unverified Users

## Overview
The system has been updated to **strictly enforce email verification**. User records in the `public.user` table will **ONLY** be created after email verification. No unverified users will exist in the custom table.

## The Problem Fixed
- ‚ùå User records were being created for unverified users
- ‚ùå Google Sign-In was creating user records immediately
- ‚ùå Database triggers were not properly checking verification status
- ‚ùå Users showed "Waiting for verification" but existed in database

## The Solution
- ‚úÖ **Strict verification**: User records only created after email confirmation
- ‚úÖ **Clean database**: All unverified users removed from `public.user` table
- ‚úÖ **Consistent flow**: Both email and Google users follow same verification process
- ‚úÖ **Proper triggers**: Database triggers only fire on explicit email verification

## How It Works Now

### Registration Flow:
1. **User registers** in Flutter app
2. **User created** in `auth.users` table (unverified)
3. **Email sent** with verification link to PHP page
4. **User clicks link** ‚Üí goes to PHP verification page
5. **PHP page verifies email** AND calls Supabase API
6. **Supabase updates** `email_confirmed_at` in `auth.users`
7. **Database trigger** creates user record in `public.user` table
8. **User can log in** to Flutter app

### Google Sign-In Flow:
1. **User signs in** with Google
2. **User created** in `auth.users` table (Google handles verification)
3. **No user record** created in `public.user` table initially
4. **User record created** via database trigger when `email_confirmed_at` is set
5. **User can log in** to Flutter app

## Database Changes

### Updated Trigger Function:
```sql
-- Function that ONLY creates user records when email is explicitly confirmed
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_email_verification()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Only create user record when email_confirmed_at changes from NULL to a timestamp
  IF NEW.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL AND OLD.email_confirmed_at IS NULL THEN
    -- Check if user record already exists to prevent duplicates
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.user WHERE email = NEW.email) THEN
      -- Insert new user record with trial period
      INSERT INTO public.user (...)
    END IF;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### Cleanup Process:
- All unverified users removed from `public.user` table
- Only verified users remain in custom table
- Database triggers ensure future users are only created after verification

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Updated SQL
Execute the updated `supabase_config_for_existing_website.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### Step 2: Clean Up Existing Data
Execute `cleanup_unverified_users.sql` to remove any existing unverified users.

### Step 3: Configure PHP Integration
1. Download `verify_email_supabase_integration.php`
2. Update Supabase URL and anon key
3. Integrate with your existing verification page

### Step 4: Test the Flow
1. Register a new user in Flutter app
2. Check Supabase Auth - should show "Waiting for verification"
3. Check `public.user` table - user should NOT exist
4. Click verification link in email
5. Verify on PHP page
6. Check Supabase Auth - should now show "Confirmed"
7. Check `public.user` table - user should now exist
8. Try logging in to Flutter app

## Verification Commands

### Check Complete Status:
```sql
-- Compare both tables to see verification status
SELECT 
  au.email,
  au.email_confirmed_at as auth_verified,
  pu.email_verified as custom_verified,
  CASE 
    WHEN au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL AND pu.email_verified THEN '‚úÖ Complete'
    WHEN au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL AND NOT pu.email_verified THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è Auth Only'
    WHEN au.email_confirmed_at IS NULL THEN '‚ùå Not Verified'
    ELSE '‚ùì Unknown'
  END as status
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.user pu ON au.email = pu.email
ORDER BY au.created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check for Unverified Users:
```sql
-- Should return 0 unverified users
SELECT COUNT(*) as unverified_users
FROM public.user 
WHERE email_verified = false OR email_verified IS NULL;
```

### Test the RPC Function:
```sql
-- Test the function directly
SELECT confirm_email_and_create_user('test@example.com');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: User record not created after verification
- Check if trigger function exists
- Verify trigger is attached to `auth.users` table
- Check if `email_confirmed_at` is being updated
- Ensure the RPC function is working correctly

### Issue 2: User still shows "Waiting for verification"
- Verify the PHP page is calling the Supabase API
- Check if `email_confirmed_at` is being updated in `auth.users`
- Ensure the RPC function is working correctly

### Issue 3: Google users can't log in
- Google users need to have their email confirmed in Supabase Auth
- Check if `email_confirmed_at` is set for Google users
- User record will be created via trigger when email is confirmed

### Issue 4: Unverified users still exist
- Run the cleanup script: `cleanup_unverified_users.sql`
- Check if any triggers are creating users before verification
- Ensure all user creation goes through the verification process

## Expected Results

### After Registration:
- ‚úÖ User exists in `auth.users` (unverified)
- ‚ùå User does NOT exist in `public.user`
- üìß Verification email sent

### After Email Verification (PHP + Supabase):
- ‚úÖ User exists in `auth.users` with `email_confirmed_at` set
- ‚úÖ User exists in `public.user` with `email_verified = true`
- ‚úÖ Supabase Auth shows "Confirmed" status
- ‚úÖ User can log into Flutter app

### After First Login:
- ‚úÖ Welcome email sent
- ‚úÖ `welcome_email_sent` updated to true

### Database State:
- ‚úÖ Only verified users exist in `public.user` table
- ‚úÖ No unverified users in custom table
- ‚úÖ All users in custom table have `email_verified = true`

## Security Notes

- The RPC function uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS
- Only the anon key is required (no service role key needed)
- The function validates the email format
- Error handling prevents sensitive information leakage
- No user records exist for unverified users
- Database triggers ensure consistent verification flow
